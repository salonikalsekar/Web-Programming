The Technologies used are:
HTML
CSS
Node.js
AJAX

MongoDB

We need to install the Node-js and MongoDB modules

Install all the packages before starting by "npm install"

Connect the MongoDB whereever necessary

01-basicPrograms
sumOfSquares(num1, num2, num3)
sayHelloTo(firstName, lastName, title);
cupsOfCoffee(howManyCups)
occurrencesOfSubstring(fullString, substring)
randomizeSentences(paragraph)

02-AsynchronousCode_Files_Promises
Working with files; particularly, reading them, creating metrics on them, and storing them using promises.

03-DatabaseConnection_MongoDB_todo
Creating a to-do list! And test it
Modules:
Database connection 
Collections defined 
Data manipulation 
Practicing the usage of promises for asynchronous code
Linking these modules together 

04-API_aboutme
A simple server that implements several routes

05-API_recipes
A simple server that provides an API for someone to Create, Read, Update, and Delete recipes. These recipes will be stored in the database.

06-HTML_CSS
Templating some basic data. 
The files in the data module do not access database calls, but still return promises; despite being a simple read-only application
Understanding what the workflow will be once you begin fitting databases back into the equation
The middlewares to setup static assets, as well as the view engine have been setup.
Printing out the template variables as a JSON string

07-TextManipulation_and_making_routes
Sending a form to the server to render the result on a new page
Intercepting a form on the client to render the result without leaving the page.

08-Browser_APIs_and_jQuery
A simple server that renders a single page. This page will keep track of several values using client side JavaScript.
Detailed the keys used and their respective values on this single page in a table with 2 columns.

09-jQuery_AJAX_Security
A very simple, unauthenticated application that stores notes in files and retrieves them to display on the page. 
Created 3 pages that are enhanced with jQuery and AJAX.
Testing for XSS attacks, so you must never allow yourself to be vulnerable to an XSS attack!

10-UserLoginSystem
Using the concepts learned on authentication, middleware, etc, implemented a basic user system.
Used Passport Local Strategy
Passport is a very simple, easy to drop in middleware that allows to quickly add application authentication.
A strategy is a way of checking whether or not a request is authenticated.
